      <p>
          Freestyle Movement is a registered non-profit company that supports Edmonton
          breakers, bboys and bgirls (commonly known as break dancers). We provide regular practice sessions,
          classes and workshops, as well as competition style events.
          We hope to see the Breaking community grow in size and in skill as people from
          different backgrounds come together and experience the culture of Hip Hop.

      <p class="text-faded">
          Every dream has a first step, and for us this is it.
          From ideas ranging from dance studio cafes, to having large open
          warehouse space for competitions, we at Freestyle Movement wanted
          to make an impact. United behind an idea, we took the first step to begin formalizing our
          Friday night practice sessions, teaching Hip Hop and Breaking workshops,
          and beginning to host dance competitions.
