      <p>
          Freestyle Movement is a registered non-profit company that supports Edmonton
          Bboys and Bgirls through providing regular practice sessions,
          teaching classes and workshops, as well as hosting competitions.
          We hope to see the Bboy community grow in size and in skill as people from
          different backgrounds come together and experience the culture of Hip Hop.

      <p class="text-faded">
          Every dream has a first step, and for us this is it.
          From ideas ranging from dance studio cafes, to having large open
          warehouse space for competitions, we at Freestyle Movement wanted
          to make an impact. United behind an idea, we took the first step to begin formalizing our
          Friday night practice sessions, teaching Hip Hop and Breaking workshops,
          and beginning to host dance competitions.

    <h3 class="text-center">Hubert</h3>
    <h4 class="text-center">President</h4>
    <p>
        Starting out as a bboy in 2007, Hubert has competed in numerous breaking competitions and performed
        along side Crazy Time Crew. Bboying is what transformed him from being a shy and slightly awkward boy
        into who he is now. The idea for a dance-studio-bubble-tea-cafe hybrid business came from a visit to
        local bubble tea shop, and from there Freestyle Movement was eventually born.

        He was inspired by breaking performances and events so he began to take dance seriously.
