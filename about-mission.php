	                is a form of freestyle hiphop dancing that originated from New York City - The Bronx. From there, it has spread across the globe through performances, competitions,
	                and social media.</p>

                    <p class="text-center text-just">In order to spread breaking to as many people as possible, we are offering our level 1 classes for free. We focus heavily on foundation. Whether it's ballet, jazz, or breaking,
                    all dance styles have their foundation. </p>

                    <p class="text-center text-just">Breaking foundation can be broken into roughly four main categories: toprock, footwork, freezes, and powermoves. These classes will equip
                    you with the moves necessary to move onto higher levels.</p>

                    <p class="text-center text-just">A Bgirl or Bboy's true test is on the dance floor. For those breakers that want to compete, we want to provide opportunities for them to test their skills against others. 
                    Whether it be in a breaking battle, or a choreographed showcase competition, dancers can inspire others to work harder and improve.</p>

                    <p class="text-center text-just">Our long term goal is to have our very own location with convenient access to public transportation and large space for dancers of all ages to use.</p>
                    <p class="text-center text-just">We understand how it feels to want to practice but not have a space to do so. Either the place is too expensive, takes too long to get to, or just doesn't fit with our schedule.</p>
                    <p class="text-center text-just">Imagine that one day we will have a session spot that's affordable, conveniently located, and open all-day-long just for breakers to practice!</p>
